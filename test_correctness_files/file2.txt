Hello, this is a test file.
It contains various patterns like numbers 12345 and special symbols %$#@!
Do you see any animals like cats or dogs or maybe birds?
How about sequences of mixed content: alpha123, 987xyz, and !@#ABC?
This line is for testing whitespace: tabs		and multiple     spaces.
Special characters that need escaping: curly braces { }, star *, plus +, and questionmark ?.
Test nested structures (parentheses) and alternation with pipes |.
A line with just a period should match any character if using dot: .
Using shorthand character classes: \s for whitespace, \d for digits, and \w for word characters.
Negation tests: \S \W \D should match non-whitespace, non-word, non-digit respectively.
